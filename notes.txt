# Justification
The whole __code shenanigans is to avoid namespace pollution i.e. numpy being accessible when importing: utils.np
The double underscore as opposed to single one is to prevent jupyter notebook from suggestsing _code when using autocomplete
In _helpers.py user warnings are temporarily turned of while importing torchaudio to silence some warnings I cannot prevent on windows at the moment

# TODO
Find a better way to avoid namespace pollution, perhaps through the __init__ ?
Find a proper fix for torchaudio's warnings
Write docs for all functions and find out if there's some go to conventions for during so
